  norovirus hit my wife last night about 1 am, so not as much work for me to do today
  


Tuesday 1/26/16
  Major work day today
  * I led our meeting at the beginning of the day setting up our biggest technical challenges left, so we worked on those first
  * I got our google map to populate directly from our Zillow API call
  * I worked out how we needed to refactor our code from it's current state as test pieces to actually run where we need it to run for our MVP
  * I worked with Frazier to refactor the code
  * I learned how to use gitHub to properly handle a merge conflict via my txt editor, then had an issue the next time I handled a merge conflict
  * I walked Evan through setting up our history page for what we need it to do, still a bit more work to do there, but we should finish tomorrow no problem

Monday 1/25/16
  I had norovirus, so stayed home and worked from there. We got a lot done, I didn't contribute as much
  * I built our nav bars for each page
  * I got a basic google map api call working in maptest.js to get us a map, and put it on maptest.html, to avoid merge conflicts
  * I helped Evan troubleshoot his work on the history page


Friday, 1/22/16
  We started our team, and I led the discussion on what our MVP and stretch goals would be Evan, Eleana and Frazier were on on our team

  * I requested and received our Zillow Web Services Identification (ZWSID) is: X1-ZWz19vugt4iux7_3e7gq, to be used for the web API we will be using.

  * I started a work list for us

  * I scaffolded our directory structure and created our gitHub repo, adding Evan, Eleana and Frazier as collaborators

  * We worked together to get our first draft wireframe of the pages done, as well as some of the domain model fleshed out
