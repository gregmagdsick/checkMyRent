  We started our team, and I led the discussion on what our MVP and stretch goals would be. Evan, Eleana and Frazier were on on our team

  * I requested and received our Zillow Web Services Identification (ZWSID) is: X1-ZWz19vugt4iux7_3e7gq, to be used for the web API we will be using.

  * I started a work list for us

  * I scaffolded our directory structure and created our gitHub repo, adding Evan, Eleana and Frazier as collaborators

  * We worked together to get our first draft wireframe of the pages done, as well as some of the domain model fleshed out
